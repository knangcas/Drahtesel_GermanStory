Awesome Story!

1. One morning at the Berlin Flughafen, a BMW M4 CS, driven by a Hund, and Porsche 911 GT3 RS, driven by professor Mehlhase, a were having a wettbewerbsfaehig race on the runway. 
2. As they were racing professor Mehlhase was playing Rammstein on her radio and started sweating profusely because her cars klimaanlage was broken.
3. The winner of this race gets an Apfelkuchen made by the famous Baeckerei by the Eltz, as well as the the other driver's car. 
4. Just as she was about to cross the finish line a hund ran in front of professor Melhase's car.
5. To make it more stressful, the klimaanlage was broken in the professor's car!
6. The next thing to happen is that Professor Melhase's car was stalled on the Hauptstrasse.
7. With nothing else she could do at the moment, professor decided to eat a loaf of day old brot from Jimmy John's she had in her BMW.
8. But Jimmy John did not offer Apfelkuchen.  She wanted a piece of Apfelkuchen at that very moment.
9. Professor decided to go to the ratskeller to have a beer.
10. To make matters even more frustrating, the ratskeller was sold out of beer!
11. But that was okay, because they had doener kebab.
12. And in the end they retired to the Eltz outside of Berlin.
